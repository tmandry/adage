- Change parent surfaces from SDL_Surface* to Image
- Change const char*s to std::strings -- Use const std::string& in function parameters
- Propagate SDL_BlitSurfaces into an own function, in order to handle errors more elegantly (?)
- Add comments! Both before each function (use doxygen), and in the code itself
